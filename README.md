This is my first ever attempt at creating a colab notebook to intergate Rclone and Torrenting. The repo is currently work in progress. 
Currently I am only focusing on the torrent to rclone remote part.
Roadmap for the future:
1. Integrate yt-dlp
2. Cloud to cloud transfer (Although already available if you type rclone commands, but I am thinking about getting a nice GUI for it.)
3. Encryption (It will be one of my main priorities. I haven't used rclone crypt ever so might be a bit challenging to figure it out)
4. File compression and decompression
